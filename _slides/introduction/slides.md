# About Me

- **Why Networks**: üñ•Ô∏è I‚Äôve studied and taught data communications for a reasonably long period of time and still find it fun and interesting. My graduate work was performance analysis of network file servers.
- **Courses**: üßë‚Äçüè´ Operating Systems, System Programming, Mobile Development, Robotics, Art and Craft of Writing Code,
- **Other Interests**: üß∞ general software development and technology, electronics, physical computing, wood and metal working, making things.
- **Fun Fact**: üéÑ For the past few years I've been completing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in December. If you have not tried it, it will surely give you practice writing code!
- **Call me**: üìõ Professor Houser works.
- **Contact**: üìß Stephen Houser \<houser@maine.edu\>

<Admonition title="Info" color='yellow-light' width="300px" v-drag="[560,400,390,110]">
üè¢ I don‚Äôt have a permanent office on-campus.<br/>
I will post office-hours availability in the next week.

üì∑ Zoom is an option, if it works for you!

# Course Resources

We will be using two primary systems during the semester.

## Brightspace

Slides, activities, exams, reading materials, grades...
Always start from the Brightspace course.

The content is organized into *weekly* modules.


## GitHub / GitHub Classroom

Project submission and tracking. You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

<Note>

Projects always ==Start== in Brightspace. You will *push* your code to GitHub upon completion.
</Note>

**Grade**

:: right ::

Final course grades thus consist of the following maximums:

| Projects   | 325 points |
| --- | --- |
| Activities | 150 points |
| Exams      | 325 points |
|           |     |
| Total      | ==800 points== |

Grades are not scaled. 90-100% is an **A**, 80-89% is a **B**, etc.. The exact point breakdown is detailed in the syllablus in **Birghtspace**.
