# Lecture Slides for USM COS 460

These slides are coded for `slidev` and built with the included `Makefile`

The `Makefile` takes an optional `BASE` variable when building HTML variants of the slides.
This variable is used to set the base URL at which the slides will be found. This, specifically is used when building to be deployed as GitHub Pages.

There is an included GitHub workflow that will build and deploy to a `gh-pages` branch.
