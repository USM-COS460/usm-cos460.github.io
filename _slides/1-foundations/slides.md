In groups of 2-3, Google the "tech stack" for a website or web based application. In your investigation, answer these two questions:

<Question>

# What technologies do they use?

# Tech Stacks

- What technologies did you find?

- Which ones "cross the network"?

- Were there any you found as *standards* (e.g. `http`)

- Were there any that were *unique* to that website or application?

- What else did you find?

Some requirements are common across all perspectives.

Some requirements are specific to a perspective; users, developers, or service provider.

# Common Requirements

These are basic requirements across all perspectives.

- The network needs to be **connected** and **scaleable**.

- The network needs to be **cost-effective**

- The network needs to **support the services** we want to use.

<Definition>

### ***Network***: Two or more **nodes** connected by a physical **link**, or two or more **networks** connected by a node.

</Definition>

- **node** is a device connected to the network.
- **link** is what connects nodes together, the physical connection.

Some other relevant terms; a **host** is a type of node, a **switch** or **router** are internally a node and a link.

**Cost-effective**


:: right ::

To be **cost-effective** data needs to be **multiplexed** over the links among nodes and networks.

```mermaid { scale: 0.75 }
graph LR
    subgraph network1[network 1]
        nodeA["üñ•Ô∏è<br/>Node A"]<-->routerA(router A)
        nodeB["üñ•Ô∏è<br/>Node B"]<-->routerA(router A)
        nodeC["üñ•Ô∏è<br/>Node C"]<-->routerA(router A)
    end

    routerA(üïã<br/>switch) e1@<===>|multiplexed</br>data|routerB(üïã<br/>switch)
    e1@{ animate: true }

    subgraph network2[network 2]
        routerB<-->nodeX["üñ•Ô∏è<br/>Node X"]
        routerB<-->nodeY["üñ•Ô∏è<br/>Node Y"]
        routerB<-->nodeZ["üñ•Ô∏è<br/>Node Z"]
    end
```
There are a few common ways we can accomplish this.

# Sharing the Wire
## A Mutiplexing Simulation

Let's play a card game to explore different ways to **multiplex** data over a single link.

Work in groups of 4. Each group gets an **Instruction Sheet** and Game Area and **15 message cards** (3 red, 3 green, 3 orange)

### Setup

- 3 **Senders** take colored cards and write a (less than 5 letter) word, one letter per card in the message data area. Include the position in the word for the letter as the sequence number.
- 1 **Receiver** setup the game board next to them where messages will be delivered.

# Sharing the Wire
# Round 1

The **Time Keeper**  (Instructor) will be the system clock. Players can only act when the time keeper says to act and they can only take one action!

- Each sender has their own lane (colored area).
- All senders place one packet in their lane at the same time.
- Receiver collects one packet from each lane, adds the new packets to pile of packets for each sender.

After time ends, the receiver decodes the messages sent by the senders.

- All senders share **one lane** (center lane).
- Senders take turns in fixed order placing their next packet.
- Receiver picks up packets one at a time and puts it into their correct received pile.
- If it is a senders turn and they have no more data, the turn is not used, the sender and reciever do nothing.

After time ends, the receiver decodes the messages sent by the senders.

- If there are no packets in the lane, senders place a packet in any order, whoever gets their packet there first wins.
- Receiver picks up packet and puts into their correct received pile.
- If a sender has no more packets to send, they do nothing.

After time ends, the receiver decodes the messages sent by the senders.

# Sharing the Wire -- Discussion

<v-clicks depth="2">

- **Round 1** - Frequency Division
    - Each sender has $1/3$ the total **bandwidth** and sends $1/3$ of a packet at a time.
    - Wasted lane when sender has no more data to send. **not efficient**

- **Round 2** - Time Division
    - Each sender has full bandwidth for $1/3$ of the time.
    - Wasted time slots when sender has no more data to send. **not efficient**

- **Round 3** - Packet Switching
    - No wasted lane or time slots
    - Senders collide when sending.
    - Receiver may need to put packets back in order.

The empty boxes above represent when no sender has any more data to send, their frequency band (or lane) goes unused.

This is how broadcast radio and television work. Each station gets a sub-band of the entire band. They broadcast continuiously and thus always have "data" to send.

```
With **Packet Switching** senders can send **whenever they have data and the link is idle**.

The empty boxes above represent when **no sender** has data to send. The time slots do not go unused. If there were **any data** from **any sender** they could use those slots to send their data.

As you likely discovered, there can be **collisions** when multiple senders try to send. We will deal with those later.

# Architecture

The *architecture* of a network is how we design the network to meet our needs. It's like a blueprint, where we make all the major decisions about how it is organized.

There are two **major architectures** in use today; the **ISO/OSI** model and the **TCP/IP** or Internet model.

They both are described as **layers** that interact with each other via well-defined **protocols**.

# Architecture

:: left ::

**Layers**

:: right ::

We view the network as a series of **layers** in a **stack**. Each layer can call functions of the layer below it in the stack and can be called by layers above it in the stack using a well defined **Application Programming Interface (API)**.

```mermaid { scale: 1.25 }
block-beta
    columns 1

  block:A
    columns 1
    block:A1["Host"]
        A
    end

    application["Application programs"]
    process["Process-to-process channels"]
    host["Host-to-host connectivity"]
    hardware["Host-to-host connectivity"]
    application -- "API" --> process
    process -- "API" --> host
    host -- "API" --> hardware
  end
```
This is a simplified view of the layers in a network stack.

**Protocols**

:: right ::

Layers have a **peer-to-peer** interface with the same layer on another host in the network.

Layers at the same level communicate with each other via data passed between them.

```mermaid { scale: 1.25 }
block-beta
columns 3

  block:A
    columns 1
    block:A1["Host 1"]
        A
    end

    lowA["Low Level"]
    highA --> lowA
    lowA -- "API" --> highA
  end
    space
  block:B

    block:B1["Host 2"]
        B
    end
    highB["High Level"]

    highB -- "API" --> lowB
    lowB --> highB
  end

lowA -- "Peer-to-peer<br/>Interafce" --> lowB
lowB --> lowA
```
This peer-to-peer interface is called a **Protocol**.

**Encapsulation**

:: right ::

For the layers to pass control information between themselves, they **encapsulate** data from higher layers into a sub-field of the data they pass with their peer.

Layers **wrap** data from higher layers with control information and pass that the next lower layer. The data is **unwrapped** by their peer.

```mermaid { scale: 1 }
block-beta
    classDef invisible fill:none,stroke:none

    columns 4
    block:A
        columns 1

        space
        host["host-to-host"]

        application --> process
        process --> host
    end
    block:B
        columns 1
        adata["[data]"]
        space
        pdata["[process|data]"]
        space

         process2 --> application2
        host2 --> process2
    end

    host-- "[host|process|data]" -->host2

This peer-to-peer interface is called a **Protocol**.

When sending data, start a the top of the stack and work downwards.

The application data is passed to the *process-to-process* layer which wraps the data with the destination **process information** as determined by the protocol.

Similarly the **host-to-host** layer will add destination **host** information. Then the data will be sent over the network (by a lower layer).

```mermaid { scale: 1 }

When receiving data, start a the bottom and work upwards.

The **host** field of the *host-to-host* layer indicates which *host* the data is for. If we are the **destination host** then the unwapped data can be passed to the next layer up.


```mermaid { scale: 1 }

    classDef invisible fill:none,stroke:none

    columns 2
    block:B
        columns 1

        host2["host-to-host"]

         process2 --> application2

The **process** field similarly tells *which process* on the host to deliver the data to.

The layers in the two architectures don't directly correspond, but we can compare them.

The Internet model does not have a *presentation* layer. It is left to the application to handle this function.

OSI *session* layer semantics are handled mostly by TCP in the Internet model.

The Internet model's *IP* layer handles functions from the OSI's transport and network layers.

The Internet model *network* layer performs the functions on the OSI network, data-link, and physical layers.

# Performance

You may have heard the terms **bandwidth** and **latency** to determine network perofmance.

In this section we will formally define them and see how to measure the performance and the capacity of a network.

This will help us understand not only how to benchmark network performance, but also the factors that can be tuned to affect that performance.

**Bandwidth**

:: right ::

**Bandwidth** is used to express the number of bits that can be transmitted over the network in a certain period of time, also called the **data rate** or **throughput**.

While this is true, **bandwidth** is actually the *width of the frequency band* data is transmitted over. A **wide** allows for more data to be transmitted during the same preiod of time.

Consider these example **bandwidth** calculations:

- On a **10 Mbps** (mega bits per second) link

    - data is transmitted at **10 million bits per second**
    - each bit takes **0.1 ŒºS** to transmit

- On a **20 Mpbs** link, each bit takes **0.05 Œºs**.

- On a **100 Mpbs** link, each bit takes **0.01 Œºs**.

**Latency**

:: right ::

**Latency** is a meausre of the **time** that it takes a message to travel from one node to another. It's also called **delay**. We consider *latency* with the following equations:

<EquationBox>

$$
\begin{align*}
\textbf{latency}        &= \text{propogation} + \text{transmission} + \text{queueing delay} \\
\textbf{popogation}     &= \text{distance} / \text{speed of light} \\
\textbf{transmission}   &= \text{size} / \text{bandwidth}
\end{align*}
$$
</EquationBox>

- **distance** is the length of the medium.
- **speed of light** is the effective speed of light.
- **size** is the size of the data.
- **bandwidth** is the data rate of the transmitted data.
- **queuing delay** is the delay introduced by system components.

Light travels across different mediums at different speeds!

| **Medium** | **Speed of Light** |
| --- | --- |
| Vacuum | $3.0 \times 10^{8} m/s$ |
| Copper | $2.3 \times 10^{8} m/s$ |
| Fiber | $2.0 \times 10^{8} m/s$ |

These are approximate speeds to give an idea of the differences.

<Note>

Don't worry, the speed of light is still constant, just constant on different mediums.

Latency is usually measured in the **Round Trip Time (RTT)** for data to traverse the network. This is the time to go to a remote node and return to the sender. Hence, *round trip*.

| **Link Type** | **Bandwidth** | **One-way Distance** | **RTT** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ethernet LAN | 1 Gbps | 50 m | 0.25 Œºs |
| Wireless LAN | 54 Mbps | 50 m | 0.33 Œºs |
| Satellite    | 1 Gbps  | 35,000 km | 230 ms |
| Cross-country fiber | 10 Gbps | 4,000 km | 40 ms |

These are approximate times to give an idea of the differences, your measurements may vary.

Consider a **10 Mbps** link with a **100 ms RTT**.

A **10 KB message** ($10 KB = 10,000 \times 8 = 80,000$ bits).<br/>Will take **8 ms** to transmit.

Because the one-way latency is 50 ms, the data will finish sending before the first bit is received on the other end.

The data is completely **on the network** or **in-flight** during that time!

## How much data can be **in-flight** at a time on the network?

$$
\begin{align*}
& \textbf{bandwidth} \times \textbf{latency} = 10\ \text{Mbps} \times 50\ \text{ms}\\
& (10 x 10^{6})\ \text{bits/second} \times (50 x 10^{-3})\ \text{seconds} \\
& 500 \times 10^{3} = 500 Kb = \textbf{\underline{62.5 KB}}
\end{align*}
$$

### ==**62.5 KB** of data can be **on the network**==

The project [pingfs](https://github.com/yarrick/pingfs) actually makes use of this to store files "on the network" without using any local storage.

Lets look at some examples in a few different scenarios.

Calcluate the total time required to transfer a **1000 KB file** in the following cases, assuming an **RTT of 50 ms**, a packet size of **1 KB** data, and an **initial 2 $\times$ RTT of "handshaking"** before data is sent.

1. Data can be sent continuiously.
2. The sender needs to wait 1 RTT between packets.
3. The sender can send 20 packets per RTT on an infinite-bandwidth link.
4. The sender can send 1, 2, 4, ... packets on the same infinite-bandwidth link.

<Note>

1KB is $2^{10} = 1,024$ not $10^{3} = 1,000$

3. The link allows infinitely fast transmit, but limits bandwidth such that only **20 packets can be setnt per RTT**.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Packets}              &= \text{Data size} / \text{Packet size}    &&= 1,000\ \text{packets} \\
\text{Chunks}               &= ceil(\text{Packets} / 20)                &&= 50 \\
\text{RTT}                  &=                                          &&= 0.05\ \text{s} \\
\text{Transmit}             &= \text{Chunks}\times\text{RTT}            &&= 2.6\ \text{s} \\
\text{One-way Propogation}  &= \text{RTT} / 4                           &&= 0.025\ \text{s} \\
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Handshake} + \text{Transmit} - \text{One-way Propogation}   &= \\
0.1 \ \text{s}   + 2.6\ \text{s}           - 0.025\ \text{s}  &= \textbf{\underline{2.575\ \text{s}}}
\end{align*}
$$

We subtract One-way Propogation as we don't need to wait after the last chunk is sent.

This exercise is very similar to the previous one, but uses a different **RTT**. Work on this one on your own for practice.

1. The bandwidth is **10 Mbps**, and data packets can be **sent continuosly**. (1.458 s)

2. The bandwidth is **10 Mbps**, but after we finish sending each data packet **we must wait one RTT** before sending the next. (124.258 s)

3. The link allows infinitely fast transmit, but limits bandwidth such that only **20 packets can be sent per RTT**. (6.32 s)
