# Applications
.left-column[
## The Web
]
.right-column[
Based on Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Designed for marked up text; Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

Includes links, formatting, style, images, video, ...

Incredibly flexible, often used by a number of applications

# Applications
.left-column[
## The Web
## EMail
]
.right-column[
The first *killer app* for The Internet

* Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP)

* Post Office Protocol (POP)

# Applications
.left-column[
## The Web
## EMail
## File Storage
]
.right-column[
Even before *the cloud* there was network storage

* Network File System (NFS)

* Common Internet File System (CIFS)

* IP Small Computer System Interconnect (iSCSI)

...and, of course, over `HTTP` these days
